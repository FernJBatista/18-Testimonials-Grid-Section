## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid

### What I learned

I think this has been a great exercise to practice grid layout. I haven't done this much but here I HAD to learn how to arrange and style the grid properly. It's a fun layout that I've always been a bit scared to use.
